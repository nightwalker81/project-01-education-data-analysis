# 📊 Project 01 — Education Data Analysis

This project is part of the **Data Engineer curriculum** and focuses on analyzing educational system data using **Python** and core **data analysis libraries**.  
The goal is to clean, explore, and interpret a real dataset to identify insights and build a foundation for more advanced data engineering and machine learning projects.

## 📘 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to:

- Explore and understand the structure of an educational dataset  
- Apply data cleaning techniques and handle anomalies  
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis  
- Generate visual insights to support decision-making  
- Prepare data for potential downstream tasks (ML, dashboards, ETL, etc.)

This project demonstrates fundamental skills in Python, data analysis, and data quality handling — **essential competencies for a Data Engineer**.

## 📑 Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Loading & Inspecting Data**  
   - Understanding dataset features  
   - Checking types, ranges, missing values  

2. **Cleaning & Preparing Data**  
   - Treating anomalies  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Applying transformations when needed  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Statistical summaries  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Grouped comparisons  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Bar charts, distributions, plots  
   - Identifying trends in educational metrics  

5. **Interpretation & Findings**  
   - Summary of meaningful insights extracted from the dataset
